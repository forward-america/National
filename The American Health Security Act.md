### A Market-Based Catastrophic Protection System

---

## Executive Summary

The American Health Security Act replaces the current fragmented healthcare system with a unified framework that:

- **Guarantees** no American faces bankruptcy from medical bills
- **Preserves** private healthcare delivery and provider choice
- **Simplifies** billing through a single national system
- **Reduces** total federal healthcare spending by $400+ billion annually
- **Unleashes** $600 billion in trapped business capital for wages and innovation

**Estimated Annual Cost:** $1.5 trillion  
**Current System Cost:** Medicare ($1.03T) + Medicaid ($900B) = **$1.93 trillion**  
**Net Savings:** ~$430 billion per year

---

## Core Principles

### Security

Age-based out-of-pocket maximums prevent medical bankruptcy while acknowledging different life stages and financial capacity.

### Choice

Privatized healthcare delivery maintains competition, innovation, and patient choice of providers.

### Simplicity

One unified billing system eliminates administrative complexity while protecting patient privacy through encrypted health records.

## The Three-Layer Protection System

### Layer 1: Personal Health Savings Account (HSA)

**Tax-Advantaged Contributions:**

- Employer contributions: Up to $7,500/year (tax deductible)
- Individual contributions: Up to $10,000/year (tax deductible)
- **Maximum combined contribution:** $17,500/person/year

**Account Features:**

- Federally managed accounts
- Funds roll over annually
- Investment growth potential
- Portable across employers

### Layer 2: Private Secondary Insurance

**Market-Based Gap Coverage:**

- Covers shortfall between HSA balance and out-of-pocket maximum
- Predictable, fixed coverage amounts enable affordable premiums
- Competitive private market ensures choice
- States may subsidize for their residents (optional)

**Example Products:**

- Young Adult Gap Plan: Covers up to $5,000
- Working Age Gap Plan: Covers up to $15,000
- Senior Gap Plan: Covers up to $25,000

### Layer 3: Federal Catastrophic Protection

**Government Coverage Above Maximums:**

**Ages 0-25:** $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum

- Government pays 100% above $5,000

**Ages 26-65:** $15,000 out-of-pocket maximum

- Government pays 100% above $15,000

**Ages 66-85:** $25,000 out-of-pocket maximum

- Government pays 100% above $25,000

**Ages 85+:** Graduated responsibility model

- Age 85-90: Government pays 75% above $25,000 (patient 25%)
- Age 90-95: Government pays 50% above $25,000 (patient 50%)
- Age 95+: Government pays 25% above $25,000 (patient 75%)

_Rationale: Acknowledges that advanced-age individuals typically have accumulated peak lifetime wealth while balancing fiscal sustainability_

## The Hidden Tax on American Innovation: Employer-Sponsored Insurance

### The $900 Billion Productivity Drain

American businesses currently spend over **$900 billion annually** on employee health insurance premiums—capital that produces zero economic growth, creates no jobs, and drives no innovation. This represents one of the largest hidden drags on the U.S. economy.

**The typical American manufacturer faces:**

- $17,393/year per employee for family coverage
- $6,890/year per employee for individual coverage
- Annual increases of 5-8%, far exceeding wage growth and inflation
- Administrative burden of managing benefits, brokers, and compliance

_This is equivalent to adding $8-10 per hour to labor costs with no productive return._

### Why Wage Growth Has Stalled

The disconnect between "total compensation" and "take-home pay" explains decades of worker frustration:

**From 2000-2023:**

- Average employer health premium costs: **+242%**
- General inflation (CPI): **+78%**
- Real wage growth: **+16%**

When healthcare premiums consume an ever-larger share of compensation budgets, wages get squeezed. The average American worker has seen their employer spend dramatically more on their "total compensation"—but healthcare insurers captured that increase, not workers' bank accounts.

**Under The American Health Security Act:**

- Employers redirect premium dollars to **HSA contributions** (capped at $7,500/year, tax-deductible)
- Remaining capital available for: **wage increases, reinvestment, expansion, R&D**
- Workers gain **portable coverage** that follows them regardless of employment

### The Competitiveness Crisis

U.S. companies compete globally against firms with no healthcare burden:

**Manufacturing example:**

- **U.S. auto manufacturer:** $17,393 family premium per worker = ~$8.36/hour labor cost
- **German competitor:** Healthcare covered by government-mandated insurance system
- **Japanese competitor:** Universal coverage through employment-based social insurance with costs ~40% lower than U.S.

**Result:** American manufacturers face a structural $8/hour disadvantage before producing a single widget.

**Under The American Health Security Act:**

- Employer cost capped at voluntary HSA contribution ($7,500 vs. $17,393 for family coverage)
- **$9,893 per employee annual savings** for companies providing family coverage
- Across the 157 million employer-insured Americans: **~$600 billion in freed capital annually**

### Unlocking Innovation Capital

What could American businesses do with $600 billion per year in freed capital?

**Conservative reallocation scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 - Wage Growth:**

- $600B ÷ 157M employees = **$3,822 per worker annually**
- Equivalent to **18.4% immediate wage increase** for average worker ($20.77/hour → $24.59/hour)

**Scenario 2 - Business Reinvestment:**

- R&D spending increase: **+47%** (current U.S. business R&D: ~$1.3T)
- Capital investment boost: **+20%** (current private fixed investment: ~$3T)
- Job creation: Enough to fund **12+ million new jobs** at median wage

**Scenario 3 - Small Business Growth:**

- 33 million small businesses each gain average **$18,000** in freed capital
- Eliminates primary barrier to hiring (healthcare costs)
- Enables competitive compensation for entrepreneurial ventures

### The Entrepreneurship Problem

The current system actively suppresses American entrepreneurship:

**"Job Lock" phenomenon:**

- 1 in 4 workers report staying in jobs primarily for health insurance
- Would-be entrepreneurs delay or abandon ventures due to coverage fears
- Spousal "insurance jobs" reduce household risk-taking capacity

**Small business formation penalty:**

- Individual market premiums: 2-3x higher than large group rates
- Small businesses can't negotiate competitive rates
- Offering coverage is cost-prohibitive for startups

**Under The American Health Security Act:**

- **Universal catastrophic protection** eliminates coverage loss fear
- Workers free to pursue entrepreneurship, gig work, or career changes
- Small businesses compete on equal footing with large employers for talent

### The Capital Reallocation Multiplier Effect

Freeing $600 billion annually creates cascading economic benefits:

1. **Direct wage growth** → increased consumer spending → business revenue growth
2. **R&D investment** → productivity gains → long-term competitiveness
3. **Capital investment** → job creation → reduced unemployment → economic expansion
4. **Entrepreneurship** → new business formation → innovation acceleration

**Estimated GDP impact:** Conservative models suggest **$1.2-1.8 trillion** in additional economic output over 5 years through the investment multiplier effect (freed capital × multiplier of 2-3).

### Employer Benefits Under The American Health Security Act

**Immediate advantages:**

- ✅ **Predictable costs:** $7,500 HSA contribution vs. unpredictable premium inflation
- ✅ **Reduced administration:** No benefits management, broker fees, compliance complexity
- ✅ **Competitive advantage:** Redirect savings to wages, benefits, or growth
- ✅ **Talent attraction:** Offer higher wages instead of complex benefits packages
- ✅ **Global competitiveness:** Eliminate structural labor cost disadvantage

**Long-term strategic benefits:**

- ✅ **Innovation capacity:** Reinvest healthcare dollars in R&D and technology
- ✅ **Workforce flexibility:** Hire talent without healthcare cost penalty
- ✅ **Market expansion:** Fund growth without healthcare cost increases
- ✅ **Recession resilience:** Lower fixed costs during economic downturns

### Addressing the "But Employers Want to Provide Healthcare" Myth

The employer-sponsored insurance system emerged accidentally from WWII wage controls—not from market demand or business preference. Modern surveys show:

- **78% of CFOs** cite healthcare costs as top financial concern
- **64% of small business owners** say healthcare costs prevent hiring
- **Only 23% of employers** view health benefits as strategic competitive advantage (vs. burden)

Employers want to **attract and retain talent**—but there are more efficient ways than managing insurance:

- **Higher wages** (direct, portable, valued by workers)
- **Better HSA contributions** (builds worker wealth, less administrative burden)
- **Performance bonuses** (rewards productivity)
- **Professional development** (increases worker value)

### Economic Liberation Through Healthcare Security

The American Health Security Act doesn't just reform healthcare—it **unleashes American economic potential** by:

- Freeing **$600 billion annually** in trapped capital
- Enabling **sustainable wage growth** for the first time in decades
- Restoring **global competitiveness** to American manufacturers
- Removing barriers to **entrepreneurship and innovation**
- Simplifying business operations and **reducing administrative waste**

This represents the **largest one-time productivity unlock** in modern American economic history—equivalent to a permanent corporate tax cut of ~$600B annually, except the benefits flow to workers, innovation, and growth rather than simply to shareholders.

_Healthcare should protect Americans from bankruptcy—not chain them to employers, suppress their wages, or drain business productivity. The American Health Security Act delivers security AND economic freedom._

## Cost Justification: Why $1.5T is Achievable

### The Spending Concentration Phenomenon

Healthcare spending in America is extraordinarily concentrated among a small percentage of the population. According to 2019 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data:

- **The top 5% of spenders account for 48.8% of all healthcare costs**
- **The top 10% of spenders account for 65% of all healthcare costs**
- **The bottom 50% of the population accounts for only 3% of healthcare spending**

**Key threshold data:**

- Top 1% threshold: $78,125+ annual spending (average: $130,087)
- Top 5% threshold: $27,560+ annual spending (average: $61,007)
- Top 10% threshold: $15,173+ annual spending (average: $40,638)
- Bottom 50%: Less than $1,313 annual spending (average: $374)

### Mapping Out-of-Pocket Maximums Against Current Spending

**Ages 0-25 with $5,000 maximum:**

- Average child healthcare spending: $4,200/year
- **Result:** Vast majority never reach the out-of-pocket maximum
- Government catastrophic coverage rarely triggered

**Ages 26-65 with $15,000 maximum:**

- Average working-age adult spending: $9,150/year
- Only ~10% of population exceeds $15,000 annually
- **Result:** 90% of working-age adults remain below government catastrophic threshold

**Ages 66-85 with $25,000 maximum:**

- Average 65+ spending: $22,350/year
- Top 5% threshold is $27,560 to exceed the maximum
- **Result:** ~95% of seniors stay below the $25,000 catastrophic threshold

### Why Government Costs Stay at $1.5T

The American Health Security Act system fundamentally differs from current Medicare/Medicaid by **only paying for catastrophic excess** rather than covering all costs for eligible populations.

**Current System Cost Structure:**

- Medicare: Pays for majority of healthcare costs for 68 million seniors
- Total Medicare spending: $1.03 trillion (2023)
- Medicaid: Pays for majority of healthcare costs for 73 million enrollees
- Total Medicaid spending: $900 billion (2023)
- **Combined: $1.93 trillion**

**The American Health Security Act Cost Structure:**

Government only pays amounts ABOVE age-based maximums:

1. **Top 5% catastrophic cases** (~16.5 million people):
    
    - Average spending: $61,007
    - Assuming $25k maximum for most (65+ concentrated)
    - Government pays: $61,007 - $25,000 = $36,007 per person
    - Subtotal: **~$595 billion**
2. **Next 5% (90-95th percentile)** (~16.5 million people):
    
    - Average spending: ~$21,000
    - Mix of age groups; many below maximums
    - Government catastrophic coverage: **~$150 billion**
3. **Ages 85+ graduated coverage:**
    
    - Extremely high costs (3x the 65-74 average)
    - 75%/50%/25% government share on tiered basis
    - Estimated cost: **~$200 billion**
4. **Other catastrophic cases** (serious illness/accidents in younger populations):
    
    - Cancer, major accidents, chronic conditions
    - Estimated cost: **~$300 billion**
5. **Administrative infrastructure:**
    
    - Unified billing system, price review board
    - Significantly lower than current fragmented system
    - Estimated cost: **~$50 billion**

**Total Estimated Federal Cost: $1.3-1.5 trillion**

**Net Annual Savings vs. Current System: $430-630 billion**

### The Three-Layer Coverage Model Reduces Federal Burden

Unlike the current system where government bears primary responsibility, The American Health Security Act distributes costs across three layers:

**Layer 1 - Personal HSA:**

- $17,500 maximum annual contribution (employer + individual)
- Covers routine care and builds reserves
- 335 million Americans × average ~$8,000 contribution = **$2.7T in private funds**

**Layer 2 - Secondary Insurance:**

- Private market gap coverage for predictable amounts
- Competitive pricing due to known maximums
- Estimated market size: **$400-600 billion annually**

**Layer 3 - Federal Catastrophic:**

- Only triggers above age-based maximums
- Concentrated on true catastrophic cases
- **$1.5 trillion annually**

### Price Control Mechanisms Further Reduce Costs

The U.S. currently spends roughly **twice per capita what peer nations spend** on healthcare. Key savings opportunities:

1. **Administrative simplification:** Unified billing system vs. current fragmented payer complexity
2. **Price transparency:** National cost database enables comparison shopping and fraud detection
3. **Reduced fraud:** Centralized review board with statistical outlier detection
4. **Elimination of cost-shifting:** Clear pricing eliminates current hospital practice of inflating private insurance costs to cover underpayments

**Conservative estimate:** Even a 10% reduction in overall healthcare costs through these mechanisms would save **$490 billion annually** from the $4.9T total.

### Risk Mitigation Factors

**Potential cost increases managed through:**

1. **Graduated 85+ responsibility model:** Prevents unlimited exposure in highest-cost demographic
2. **Price review board:** Prevents gaming and excessive billing once patients hit maximums
3. **Secondary insurance market:** Competitive pressure keeps gap coverage affordable
4. **HSA accumulation:** Healthy years build reserves for high-cost years
5. **State flexibility:** States can supplement for vulnerable populations without federal mandate

### Conclusion: $1.5T is Fiscally Sound

The $1.5 trillion estimate is **conservative and achievable** because:

✅ **Spending concentration means most Americans never trigger catastrophic coverage**  
✅ **Government only pays excess above maximums, not total costs**  
✅ **HSA and secondary insurance layers cover costs up to maximums**  
✅ **Administrative efficiency and fraud reduction offset cost growth**  
✅ **$430+ billion annual savings vs. current Medicare/Medicaid spending**

The extraordinary concentration of healthcare spending - where the bottom 50% of Americans account for only 3% of costs - means that catastrophic protection can be provided universally at lower cost than the current fragmented system.

## Medicare Transition Strategy

### Long-Term Phase-Out Rationale

Current Medicare trajectory is fiscally unsustainable. The American Health Security Act provides:

- **Superior protection:** $25,000 maximum vs. unlimited exposure in traditional Medicare
- **Simplified coverage:** Eliminates Parts A, B, D complexity and need for supplemental insurance
- **Fiscal sustainability:** Predictable costs vs. open-ended spending

### Implementation Approach

- Multi-decade transition (20-30 years)
- Grandfathering provisions for current beneficiaries
- Gradual enrollment shift to The American Health Security Act for new retirees
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment

**Political Acknowledgment:** This represents the most challenging aspect of implementation but is essential for long-term fiscal health.

---

## Addressing Equity & Access

### Low-Income Support Strategy

Rather than creating new federal income-based subsidies (which increase bureaucracy and drive price inflation), the system relies on:

1. **Fixed, known maximums** enable affordable secondary insurance
2. **State-level flexibility** for targeted assistance programs
3. **HSA wealth building** over working years
4. **Competitive insurance market** keeps gap coverage affordable

### Non-Citizen Healthcare

- Emergency care obligations maintained
- Private pay options available
- Private insurance market accessible
- No federal subsidy burden

---

## Implementation Feasibility

### Cost Control Mechanisms

**Why $1.5T is achievable:**

1. **Spending concentration:** 5% of population accounts for 50% of healthcare costs - catastrophic coverage targets this efficiently
2. **Average spending below maximums:** Most Americans spend far less than their age-based maximum
3. **Price review effectiveness:** Reducing fraud and excessive pricing (US pays 2x peer nations)
4. **Administrative efficiency:** Unified system eliminates duplicate bureaucracies

### Revenue Sources

1. Redirected Medicare/Medicaid funding: $1.93T baseline
2. Tax-advantaged HSA contributions: Offset individual costs
3. General tax revenue: Only for net catastrophic costs
4. Existing healthcare-related tax streams

---

## Key Metrics & Accountability

### Success Measures

- Medical bankruptcy rates (target: <1%)
- Average out-of-pocket costs by age group
- Healthcare price inflation vs. general inflation
- Administrative costs as % of total spending
- Patient satisfaction and access metrics
- Wage growth correlation with freed employer capital
- Small business formation rates
- Entrepreneurship activity metrics

### Regular Review

- Annual cost analysis vs. projections
- Adjustment of out-of-pocket maximums for inflation
- Price review board effectiveness assessment
- Secondary insurance market competitiveness evaluation
- Economic impact measurement (GDP, wages, investment)

## Why America Needs The American Health Security Act Now

### The System is Broken - And You Know It

**Meet Jennifer, a 42-year-old teacher in Ohio:**

Jennifer pays $12,000 per year in premiums through her employer. When she needed surgery for a torn rotator cuff, she still paid $6,800 out-of-pocket. Her total healthcare spending that year: **$18,800** - more than she spends on her mortgage.

She can't switch jobs because she fears losing coverage. She can't start the tutoring business she's dreamed about. She's trapped.

**Meet Carlos, a 67-year-old retiree in Arizona:**

Carlos spent his career saving for retirement. Then his wife got cancer. Despite having Medicare AND supplemental insurance, they've paid over $45,000 out-of-pocket in two years. They're selling their home to cover medical bills.

Medicare was supposed to protect him. Instead, he's going bankrupt.

**Meet Amanda, a 28-year-old entrepreneur in Colorado:**

Amanda has a great business idea and angel investors ready to fund it. But she can't leave her corporate job - she needs the health insurance. Individual market plans cost $650/month with a $8,000 deductible.

Her dreams are on hold because of healthcare.

### Three Americans. Three Different Problems. One Solution.

**The American Health Security Act** guarantees that:

- Jennifer's maximum out-of-pocket would be **$15,000** (not unlimited) - and she'd be building an HSA to cover it
- Carlos's maximum would be **$25,000** (not $45,000+) - and the government covers everything above that
- Amanda could quit her job tomorrow with **guaranteed catastrophic protection** - no more job lock

### What You'll Experience Under The American Health Security Act

**As a Working American:**

- Your employer stops paying $17,000/year for insurance premiums
- That money goes to **YOUR HSA** ($7,500) and **YOUR WAGES** (the rest)
- You get a **guaranteed maximum** - never more than $5,000-$25,000 per year
- You choose your own doctor, your own hospital, your own care
- **No more job lock** - coverage follows you anywhere

**As a Senior:**

- **Simpler than Medicare** - no Parts A, B, D confusion
- **Better protection** - $25,000 cap instead of unlimited exposure
- **No gap insurance needed** - one clear maximum
- Everything above $25,000: **100% covered by the government**

**As a Business Owner:**

- **$10,000+ saved per employee** in premium costs
- That capital goes to **wages, growth, or your pocket**
- **No benefits administration headaches**
- **Compete globally** without the healthcare cost disadvantage

**As an Entrepreneur:**

- **Start your business** without fear of losing coverage
- **Universal catastrophic protection** whether employed or not
- **Portable coverage** that moves with you
- **Predictable maximums** let you budget and plan

### The Choice is Clear

**Current System:**

- ❌ Medical bankruptcy is common
- ❌ Premiums rise 5-8% annually (forever)
- ❌ Employers drain capital on healthcare
- ❌ Workers trapped in jobs for insurance
- ❌ Complex, fragmented, bureaucratic
- ❌ Costs $1.93 trillion federally

**The American Health Security Act:**

- ✅ Medical bankruptcy eliminated
- ✅ Known, fixed maximums you can plan for
- ✅ $600 billion freed for wages and innovation
- ✅ Complete job mobility and entrepreneurship
- ✅ Simple, unified, transparent
- ✅ Costs $1.5 trillion federally - **$430 billion less**

### This Isn't Socialized Medicine - It's Economic Freedom

The American Health Security Act is **not** government-run healthcare:

- ✅ You pick your doctor
- ✅ Private hospitals compete for your business
- ✅ Market-based pricing with transparency
- ✅ Innovation and competition preserved
- ✅ Government only covers true catastrophic costs

It's a **safety net**, not a takeover. The government guarantees you won't go bankrupt - but how you get care is entirely up to you.

### The Wage Growth America Deserves

For 23 years, your wages have barely budged. You've been told the economy is growing, profits are up, productivity is rising. So where's your raise?

**It went to healthcare premiums.**

From 2000-2023:

- Your employer's healthcare costs: **+242%**
- Your real wages: **+16%**

Every year, your boss had to choose: give you a raise, or cover the insurance premium increase. The insurance company won every time.

**The American Health Security Act changes that equation:**

- Employer healthcare cost: **Capped at $7,500 HSA contribution**
- Freed capital: **$10,000+ per employee**
- That money becomes: **Your wage increase**

Average American worker could see **$3,800+ more in annual wages** when employers redirect premium savings.

Want to know why you can't afford a house, why groceries strain your budget, why you're working harder than your parents but getting less? Healthcare costs ate your prosperity.

**The American Health Security Act gives it back.**

## Messaging Guide: How to Talk About The American Health Security Act

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

_"The American Health Security Act guarantees no American goes bankrupt from medical bills - with clear maximums of $5,000 to $25,000 based on your age. The government covers everything above that. You keep your doctor, your choice, your freedom. But your employer stops wasting $17,000 per worker on premiums and puts that money in your HSA and your paycheck instead. Healthcare security without healthcare socialism."_

### The Kitchen Table Pitch (2 minutes)

_"Right now, American families live in fear of medical bills. You could do everything right - have insurance, work hard, save money - and still go bankrupt if you get cancer or have a major accident._

_The American Health Security Act ends that fear. Based on your age, you'd have a clear maximum you could ever pay out-of-pocket: $5,000 if you're young, $15,000 if you're working age, $25,000 if you're a senior. Everything above that? The government covers 100%._

_You'd build up a tax-free Health Savings Account - your employer could put in $7,500, you could add $10,000 more. That money is yours, rolls over every year, and covers your routine care._

_If you have a big medical event, you use your HSA first. If you need more, you can buy affordable gap insurance because insurers know exactly what they're covering - say, the space between your HSA and your $15,000 maximum. And if you go above your maximum? The government takes over._

_Meanwhile, your employer stops spending $17,000+ per year on your insurance premiums. That's not sustainable. Under the American Health Security Act, they'd contribute to your HSA instead and could give you a real raise with the savings._

_You get security. You get choice. You get wage growth. And the government spends $430 billion less than the current Medicare and Medicaid system._

_That's the American Health Security Act."_

### Countering Common Objections

**"This sounds like government-run healthcare / socialism"**

_"No - this is the opposite. The American Health Security Act only does what government should do: protect you from catastrophic financial ruin. Everything else stays private. You pick your doctor. Private hospitals compete for your business. Private insurers offer gap coverage. The market sets prices. The government just guarantees you won't go bankrupt - period."_

**"What about people who can't afford the out-of-pocket maximum?"**

_"That's why we have three layers. Your HSA builds over time - $17,500 per year in contributions. Gap insurance covers the space between your HSA and your maximum - and it's affordable because insurers know exactly what they're covering. States can help their residents if needed. And if you still hit your maximum, the government takes over from there."_

**"Won't people overuse healthcare if they're covered?"**

_"They still pay out-of-pocket up to their maximum - this isn't free healthcare. But here's what we know: 50% of Americans spend less than $1,300 per year on healthcare. The system is designed for catastrophic protection, not unlimited routine care."_

**"What about Medicare? Seniors love Medicare."**

_"The American Health Security Act is BETTER than Medicare. Right now, traditional Medicare has unlimited out-of-pocket exposure - you can go bankrupt on Medicare. The American Health Security Act caps you at $25,000 and covers everything above that. Plus it's simpler - no Parts A, B, D to figure out, no gap insurance to buy separately."_

**"How do we trust the government cost estimates?"**

_"Because we're not guessing. We know healthcare spending is concentrated - the top 5% account for 48.8% of all costs. We know most people spend way less than their age-based maximum. The government only pays when someone exceeds that maximum - and we can predict that based on actual spending data. Current Medicare/Medicaid spends $1.93 trillion covering everything for 141 million people. The American Health Security Act spends $1.5 trillion covering only catastrophic excess for 335 million people."_

## Frequently Asked Questions

### For Individuals & Families

**Q: What happens if I lose my job?**

A: Your catastrophic protection stays with you - it's universal, not tied to employment. Your HSA is yours and portable. You might need to buy gap insurance on the individual market, but catastrophic protection is guaranteed regardless of employment status.

**Q: Can I keep my current doctor?**

A: Yes. The American Health Security Act doesn't change your ability to choose providers - it only changes how the system prevents bankruptcy. You pick your doctors, hospitals, and care.

**Q: What if I have a chronic condition?**

A: Your out-of-pocket maximum is based only on your age, not your health status. If you're 45 with diabetes, your maximum is still $15,000 - same as a perfectly healthy 45-year-old. Everything above that is covered.

**Q: How does this help me if I'm healthy and rarely go to the doctor?**

A: Two ways. First, your employer can give you a meaningful raise with the money they save on premiums. Second, you're protected if something catastrophic happens - car accident, unexpected cancer, etc. You're one bad day away from needing this protection.

**Q: What about prescription drugs?**

A: They count toward your out-of-pocket maximum just like any other medical expense. Once you hit your maximum, prescriptions are fully covered.

**Q: If my employer contributes $7,500 to my HSA and I never use it, where does it go?**

A: It's yours. It rolls over every year, can be invested and grow, and builds long-term wealth. Think of it like a 401(k) for healthcare.

### For Seniors

**Q: I'm on Medicare now. How would this affect me?**

A: Current Medicare beneficiaries would be grandfathered. New retirees would transition to The American Health Security Act over 20-30 years. The American Health Security Act provides better protection ($25,000 maximum vs. unlimited exposure) and is simpler (no Parts A, B, D).

**Q: What about Medicare Advantage plans?**

A: During the transition period, Medicare Advantage would continue. Long-term, the private gap insurance market would serve a similar function - covering the space between your HSA and your catastrophic maximum.

**Q: I'm 85. Why should I pay 25% above my maximum when younger people pay nothing?**

A: The graduated model (75%/50%/25% government coverage) for 85+ acknowledges that this age group has typically accumulated peak lifetime wealth and accounts for extremely high costs. However, even at age 95+, you'd never pay more than 75% above $25,000 - far better protection than Medicare offers.

### For Businesses

**Q: Are employers required to contribute to HSAs?**

A: No. The $7,500 employer contribution is voluntary and tax-deductible. However, most employers will want to contribute to remain competitive for talent - especially when it costs less than current premium obligations.

**Q: What happens to our existing health insurance contracts?**

A: During implementation, there would be a transition period. Employers could gradually shift from premium payments to HSA contributions as contracts expire.

**Q: Can we contribute more than $7,500 to employee HSAs?**

A: The $7,500 is the tax-deductible limit for employers. However, you could provide additional compensation that employees could use for their individual HSA contributions (up to $10,000) or other purposes.

**Q: What about workers' compensation?**

A: Workers' compensation is separate and remains unchanged. The American Health Security Act only affects personal healthcare financing.

### For Healthcare Providers

**Q: How do we get paid under this system?**

A: Same as now - you provide care, submit a bill. The difference is billing goes through one unified system instead of hundreds of different insurers. Payment comes from the patient's HSA first, then their gap insurance if applicable, then the government if they've exceeded their maximum.

**Q: Will this reduce our revenue?**

A: Not necessarily. While the system aims to reduce overall healthcare costs through transparency and fraud reduction, you'll also benefit from simplified billing (one system vs. many payers) and guaranteed payment for catastrophic cases (government covers above maximums).

**Q: What stops patients from demanding unnecessary care once they hit their maximum?**

A: Patients still pay out-of-pocket up to their maximum - this isn't free care. Once they exceed their maximum, the Federal Price Review Board monitors for outlier billing patterns and fraud. Medical necessity standards still apply.

**Q: Can we balance-bill patients?**

A: The system requires transparent pricing in the national database, but doesn't prevent balance billing. However, competitive pressure and price transparency would make excessive balance billing difficult.

### About the System

**Q: How is this different from the Affordable Care Act?**

A: ACA tried to make insurance universal but kept the complex private insurance system. The American Health Security Act simplifies to three clear layers: HSAs for routine care, gap insurance for predictable amounts, government for catastrophic costs. It's simpler, cheaper, and provides better protection.

**Q: How is this different from Medicare for All?**

A: Medicare for All is government-run, single-payer healthcare - the government pays for everything and controls delivery. The American Health Security Act keeps private delivery, private choices, and market competition. Government only covers catastrophic costs above age-based maximums.

**Q: What if I live in a rural area with limited providers?**

A: The American Health Security Act doesn't change provider availability - it changes payment structure. Rural healthcare access challenges exist today and would require separate policy solutions. However, simplified billing might make rural practice more viable.

**Q: How does this work with employer wellness programs?**

A: Employers could still offer wellness programs, potentially as benefits that reduce employees' need to tap their HSA funds. The portable nature of HSAs might actually encourage better health behaviors.

**Q: What about mental health and addiction treatment?**

A: All healthcare spending counts toward your out-of-pocket maximum, including mental health and addiction treatment. These are protected the same as physical health conditions.

**Q: Can states opt out?**

A: No - catastrophic protection is universal federal policy. However, states have flexibility to provide additional support (subsidized gap insurance, HSA contributions for low-income residents, etc.).

**Q: What happens in a pandemic or national health emergency?**

A: The government's catastrophic coverage obligation would continue - potentially with enhanced funding if many people simultaneously exceeded their maximums. The system is designed to handle concentration of costs.

**Q: How do you prevent insurance companies from gaming the gap insurance market?**

A: Gap insurance covers predictable, fixed amounts (e.g., "covers up to $15,000 for working-age adults"). This makes pricing transparent and competitive. State insurance regulators would continue oversight of the market.

**Q: What about people who can't afford gap insurance?**

A: They'd rely on their HSA and potentially state assistance programs. If they exceed their maximum without gap insurance, the federal catastrophic coverage takes over. The key insight: most people spend less than their maximum, so gap insurance is optional, not mandatory.

**Q: How do you transition 141 million people off Medicare/Medicaid?**

A: Very gradually over 20-30 years with grandfathering. Current beneficiaries stay on their existing programs. New retirees and new low-income enrollees would join The American Health Security Act system. The transition is long enough that no one loses existing coverage.

## Conclusion

The American Health Security Act represents a fundamental redesign of American healthcare financing that:

- **Costs $430 billion less** than the current system annually
- **Frees $600 billion** in business capital for wages and innovation
- **Protects every American** from medical bankruptcy with age-appropriate maximums
- **Preserves market dynamics** in healthcare delivery
- **Simplifies the system** with unified infrastructure
- **Drives economic growth** through capital reallocation
- **Builds toward sustainability** with responsible long-term Medicare transition

This is healthcare security without healthcare socialism - market-based catastrophic protection that puts patients first, controls costs, unleashes economic growth, and ensures no American faces financial ruin from illness or injury.

_"Every American gets a health savings account and guaranteed protection against bankruptcy - with out-of-pocket maximums that can never exceed $5,000 to $25,000 based on age. The federal government guarantees coverage beyond that. How you get to that maximum is your choice: save in your HSA, buy affordable gap insurance, or rely on state programs if your state offers them. And your employer? They can redirect premium dollars to your wages instead. Simple. Secure. Your healthcare, your choice. Your economic freedom."_

## Call to Action

### For Policymakers

The current healthcare system is fiscally unsustainable and economically destructive. The American Health Security Act offers a path to:

- **$430 billion in annual federal savings**
- **$600 billion in freed private capital**
- **Universal catastrophic protection**
- **Market-based delivery and choice**

This is the rare policy that reduces federal spending while expanding protection and driving economic growth. It deserves serious consideration and bipartisan support.

**Next Steps:**

1. Request CBO scoring of this framework
2. Commission pilot program feasibility studies
3. Convene stakeholder working groups
4. Draft legislative language
5. Build bipartisan coalition

### For Healthcare Leaders

Your industry faces mounting pressures: rising costs, administrative complexity, regulatory burden, and public frustration. The American Health Security Act simplifies your world:

- **One billing system** instead of hundreds of payers
- **Transparent pricing** instead of opaque negotiations
- **Guaranteed payment** for catastrophic cases
- **Reduced administrative overhead**

Engage now to shape implementation in ways that work for providers while serving patients.

### For Business Leaders

You're hemorrhaging capital on healthcare premiums while your competitors in Germany, Japan, and Korea face no such burden. The American Health Security Act levels the playing field and frees resources for:

- **Wage increases** to attract and retain talent
- **R&D investment** to drive innovation
- **Business expansion** and job creation
- **Global competitiveness**

This is your opportunity to redirect $10,000+ per employee from insurance premiums to productive use.

### For the American People

You deserve better than living in fear of medical bankruptcy. You deserve better than being trapped in jobs for insurance. You deserve better than watching your wages stagnate while insurance premiums skyrocket.

**The American Health Security Act delivers:**

- Security: You'll never go bankrupt from medical bills
- Freedom: Change jobs, start businesses, live your life
- Prosperity: Your wages can grow again
- Simplicity: Clear maximums, portable coverage, real protection

This isn't about left or right. It's about security, freedom, and prosperity for every American.

**The time for incremental fixes is over. The time for The American Health Security Act is now.**
